IRON PAC-MAN

The goal of this week's Ironhack challenge is to build a basic but functional game that can be rendered and played in a web browser.
To this end, I chose Pac-Man as the theme for my game. 

I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and compile my Pac-Man imitation. It is said, after all, that imitation is the highest form of flattery.

More importantly, I will be using techniques that employ the HTML5 Canvas feature rather than centralizing everything with DOM manipulation. 
That is not to say this game will not employ the DOM at all, but the primary means of rendering with be with Canvas.

I will primarily use Microsoft Visual Studio and the Google Developer Console to render and debug my code. 
This is one of the largest projects I have ever attempted alone; nonetheless, I anticipate the successful creation of a viable working model of the iconic Pac-Man game.
The game is currently projected to be deployed on my website @ https://safethishome.com/applications/pac-man-game/

Wish me luck!
