IRON PAC-MAN

The goal of this week's Ironhack challenge was to build a basic but functional game that can be rendered and played in a web browser.
To this end, I chose Pac-Man as the theme for my game. 

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and compile my Pac-Man imitation. It is said, after all, that imitation is the highest form of flattery.

More importantly, I used techniques that employ DOM manipulation. This is in contrast to my inital game 'Bouncy Blast', which uses the HTML5 canvas feature.

I primarily used Microsoft Visual Studio and the Google Developer Console to render and debug my code. 
This was one of the largest projects I have ever attempted alone; nonetheless, I achieved the successful creation of a viable working model of the iconic Pac-Man game. 
Credit for assistance goes to my instructors Juan and Niko, who assisted with both my starter code and the integration of the ghost feature.
The reason the game is called IRON PAC-MAN is that it is practically impossible to beat in the traditional sense, as you will see.
The game is currently deployed at: https://killshot13.github.io/iron-pacman/
