# IRON PAC-MAN

### AT A GLANCE: Technologies Employed

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* DOM manipulation

The goal of this project was to build a basic but functional game that can be rendered and played in a web browser.
To this end, I chose Pac-Man as the theme for my game. It is said, after all, that imitation is the highest form of flattery.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and compile my Pac-Man tribute. More importantly, I used techniques that employ DOM manipulation. This is in contrast to my inital game 'Bouncy Blast', which uses the HTML5 canvas feature.

I primarily used VS Code and Dev Tools to render and debug my code. This was one of the largest projects I have ever attempted alone; nonetheless, I achieved the successful creation of a viable working model of the iconic Pac-Man game. 

Credit for assistance goes to my Ironahck instructors [Juan](https://github.com/JuanGrajales) and [Niko](https://github.com/Tzikas), who assisted with both my starter code and the integration of the ghost sprite. The reason the game is called IRON PAC-MAN is that it is very hard to beat in the traditional sense, because, as you will see, I added a special ability to the ghost since there is only one.

I am using GitHub Pages to render [the finished product](https://killshot13.github.io/iron-pacman/), which is playable in any modern web browser using the arrow keys for control.
